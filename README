This project was mainly used to help us to learn Git and how to use 
it for a project. This project is made using code that I wrote for 
CS 121. It pushes integers ontothe stack and then removes them from the
stack.

Kevin Dorscher changed "main.cpp" so an array of intigers holds the stack in reverse order.
