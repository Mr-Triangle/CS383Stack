This project was mainly used to help us to learn Git and how to use 
it for a project. This project is made using code that I wrote for 
CS 121. It pushes integers ontothe stack and then removes them from the
stack.

Kevin Dorscher changed "main.cpp" 

Added a function to store the pop order of the stack, reverse order of the original string.
This array is only of size 5, since only 5 values are pushed onto the stack, but
I can change the size later if needed.
